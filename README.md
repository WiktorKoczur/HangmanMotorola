# HangmanMotorola

Hello! My name is Wiktor Koczur. I have graduated from the Cracow University of Economics, majoring in Economics. 
Since when I started studying Economics I wanted to analyze data, so when our teacher showed us how to make some programs,
I found it pretty cool and intriguing and started coding by myself.
I've started learning Java, make some simple programs, and solve some algorithmic tasks.
Thanks to it I believe I love programming and want to make my professional career as c# developer in Motorola.
